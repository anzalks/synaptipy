"""Placeholder for event detection logic (e.g., spike detection)."""
# Implement functions or classes for detecting events in Channel data.
# Example:
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.signal import find_peaks
# from .data_model import Channel
#
# def detect_spikes(channel: Channel, trial_index: int, threshold: float, prominence: float = 1.0):
#     data = channel.get_data(trial_index)
#     if data is None:
#         return []
#     # Example simple threshold crossing detection
#     # peaks, properties = find_peaks(data, height=threshold, prominence=prominence)
#     # Convert peak indices to times using channel.get_time_vector(trial_index)
#     # Return list of event times or event objects
#     pass
