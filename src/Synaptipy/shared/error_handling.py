"""
Custom Exception classes for Synaptipy.

This module defines a hierarchy of exception classes specific to Synaptipy.
All custom exceptions inherit from the base SynaptipyError class, which
itself inherits from Python's Exception class.

These custom exceptions provide more specific error handling for various
application components and help route errors to appropriate handlers.
