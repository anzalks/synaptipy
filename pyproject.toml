# ==============================================================================
# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (NOT handled by pip)
# ==============================================================================
# 
# For full GUI functionality, Qt6 system libraries must be available:
# - Windows: Qt6 runtime libraries (qtbase, qtdeclarative, etc.)
# - macOS: Qt6 framework
# - Linux: Qt6 development packages
#
# These are NOT Python packages and cannot be installed via pip!
# Use conda or system package managers to install Qt6 first.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: PySide6 requires Qt6 system libraries for full GUI functionality
# These are NOT Python packages and cannot be installed via pip
# Users must ensure Qt6 is available on their system before installation

# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: Qt6 System Libraries Required
# ==============================================================================
# 
# Synaptipy requires Qt6 system libraries for GUI functionality (file dialogs, 
# file operations, etc.). These are NOT automatically installed with pip.
#
# INSTALLATION METHODS:
#
# 1. SINGLE COMMAND (pip) - REQUIRES Qt6 ON SYSTEM:
#    # First, ensure Qt6 is available on your system:
#    # - Windows: Install Qt6 from qt.io or use conda
#    # - macOS: Install Qt6 from qt.io or use conda  
#    # - Linux: Install Qt6 from package manager or use conda
#    
#    pip install -e .
#    
#    ⚠️ WARNING: If Qt6 is not available, GUI will be partially functional
#    (file dialogs, file operations will fail)
#
# 2. CONDA ENVIRONMENT (RECOMMENDED - handles Qt6 automatically):
#    conda create -n synaptipy python=3.9
#    conda activate synaptipy
#    conda install -c conda-forge qt pyside6 pyqtgraph
#    pip install -e .
#
# The conda method is preferred as it automatically handles Qt6 system libraries.
