# Note: PySide6 requires Qt6 system libraries for full GUI functionality
# On some systems, you may need to install Qt6 separately or use conda

# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: Qt6 System Libraries Required
# ==============================================================================
# 
# Synaptipy requires Qt6 system libraries for GUI functionality (file dialogs, 
# file operations, etc.). These are NOT automatically installed with pip.
#
# INSTALLATION METHODS:
#
# 1. SINGLE COMMAND (pip):
#    pip install -e .
#    Note: This installs all Python dependencies but Qt6 system libraries 
#    must be available on your system for full GUI functionality.
#
# 2. CONDA ENVIRONMENT (Recommended for full functionality):
#    conda create -n synaptipy python=3.9
#    conda activate synaptipy
#    conda install -c conda-forge qt pyside6 pyqtgraph
#    pip install -e .
#
# The conda method is preferred as it handles Qt6 system libraries automatically.
