## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- pip or conda package manager

### Installing from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anzalks/synaptipy.git
cd synaptipy
pip install -e .
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: This installs all Python dependencies, but Qt6 system libraries must be available on your system for full GUI functionality (file dialogs, file operations, etc.).

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Conda Environment Setup (Recommended)

For isolated development and testing:

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n synaptipy python=3.9

# Activate the environment
conda activate synaptipy

# Install Qt6 system libraries and PySide6 (REQUIRED for GUI functionality)
conda install -c conda-forge qt pyside6 pyqtgraph

# Install Synaptipy in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The Qt6 system libraries are required for file operations, file dialogs, and full GUI functionality. Installing only with `pip install -e .` will result in a partially functional application.

## Quick Start

### GUI Application

After installation, run the application using the commands shown in the [Usage](#running-the-application) section below.

**Startup Process**: The application features an intelligent welcome screen that provides:
- Real-time loading progress with detailed status updates
- Step-by-step initialization of core components (Qt framework, PyQtGraph, styling, main window, analysis modules)
- Brain icon and modern interface design
- Smooth transition to the main interface once loading is complete
- Consistent theme throughout the entire startup process

This significantly improves the user experience by providing clear feedback during startup and eliminating the previous slow loading times.

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from Synaptipy.core.data_model import Recording
from Synaptipy.infrastructure.file_readers.neo_adapter import NeoAdapter
from Synaptipy.analysis.resistance_analysis import calculate_input_resistance

# Load a recording
neo_adapter = NeoAdapter()
recording = neo_adapter.read_recording("path/to/data.abf")

# Access channels
v_channel = recording.get_channel_by_name("Vm")
i_channel = recording.get_channel_by_name("Im")

# Analyze input resistance
result = calculate_input_resistance(
    v_channel=v_channel,
    i_channel=i_channel,
    baseline_window=[0.1, 0.2],  # seconds
    response_window=[0.5, 0.6],  # seconds
    trial_index=0
)

print(f"Input Resistance: {result['Rin (MŒ©)']} MŒ©")
```

See the [examples](examples/) directory for more detailed examples.

## Styling & Theme System

Synaptipy features an intelligent cross-platform styling system that:

- **Automatically detects your system theme** (light/dark mode) on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Uses native platform styling** for consistent appearance across operating systems
- **Maintains white plot backgrounds** for optimal data visualization regardless of UI theme
- **Eliminates theme conflicts** that previously caused patchwork styling issues
- **Provides seamless user experience** from welcome screen through main interface

The application now maintains your preferred system theme throughout the entire session, ensuring a consistent and professional appearance.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python scripts/run_tests.py
```

Or run specific tests:

```bash
python scripts/run_tests.py --verbose --test test_main_window
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Theme/Styling Issues:**
- If you experience inconsistent UI themes or patchwork styling, ensure you're using the latest version
- The application automatically detects and respects your system theme
- Plot backgrounds remain white for optimal data visualization

**Startup Issues:**
- If the welcome screen doesn't transition to the main GUI, check the logs in `~/.synaptipy/logs/`
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed in your conda environment
- Use `conda run -n synaptipy synaptipy-gui` for consistent environment execution

**Qt6/File Operation Issues:**
- If the GUI starts but file opening doesn't work, you're missing Qt6 system libraries
- Solution: `conda install -c conda-forge qt pyside6 pyqtgraph` before installing Synaptipy
- The `synaptipy` environment works because it has the full Qt6 stack installed
- The `sudeepta` environment fails because it only has Python packages without Qt6 system libraries

**Performance Issues:**
- The welcome screen now provides real-time feedback during startup
- Initial loading times have been significantly improved
- Check logs for any component initialization delays

```

You can also set the environment variable `SYNAPTIPY_DEV_MODE=1` to achieve the same effect:

#### Windows
```cmd
# Command Prompt
set SYNAPTIPY_DEV_MODE=1 && synaptipy-gui

# PowerShell
$env:SYNAPTIPY_DEV_MODE=1; synaptipy-gui

# Conda environment
conda run -n synaptipy synaptipy-gui --dev
```

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
# Set environment variable and run
SYNAPTIPY_DEV_MODE=1 synaptipy-gui

# Or export for current session
export SYNAPTIPY_DEV_MODE=1
synaptipy-gui

# Conda environment
conda run -n synaptipy synaptipy-gui --dev
```

Development mode provides:
- Detailed logging output (file + console)
- Function call tracing for debugging
- Additional diagnostic information

### Logs

Logs are stored in the following locations by default:
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.synaptipy\logs\`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.synaptipy/logs/`

You can specify a custom log directory with:

#### Windows
```cmd
synaptipy-gui --log-dir C:\custom\path\to\logs
